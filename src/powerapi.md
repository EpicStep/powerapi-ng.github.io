PowerAPI is a middleware toolkit for building software-defined power meters.
Software-defined power meters are configurable software libraries that can
estimate the power consumption of software in real-time.
As a middleware toolkit, PowerAPI offers the capability of assembling power
meters _«à la carte»_ to accommodate user requirements.
